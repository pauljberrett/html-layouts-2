                <p> I will tell a cool story of a man trying to learn how to program. He found a class that helped teach him the fundamentals. This place
                 is called devMountain. Thanks to their help he was able to make some very basic pages in the first week. These are them. The red button takes
                 you to my first page in this project. The blue button takes you to my third page in this project. This page is the second</p>

            <p>I dont think the BYU Cougars can keep it up. They have a terribly hard schedule and they seem to only be able to win at the last second.
            If they are able to make an amazing win against UCLA I like our odds a lot better</p>
